# mangadex-downloader
A simple Mangadex downloader I mocked up long ago and rewrote recently. 

# Issue
It's slow, but eventually it should get the job done.

# Syntax
None. Just run the script and it will guide you through the process of downloading manga.
Pro-Tip: When typing in the chapter to start downloading from, if you place an exclamation mark (!) in front of the number, the program will download only that chapter.
